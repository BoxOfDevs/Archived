    What compatability does ReportQuestions have?

    ReportQuestions is designed to be used with PocketMine-MP, and as it has only been tested with PM-MP although it may work with others like Genysis, don't be surprised if you find bugs! Also, we cannot assure you that ReportQuestions will be compatible will all other plugins, so if you find that a plugin is causing errors with ReportQuestions, please ask the plugin developer to add ReportQuestions compatability.
