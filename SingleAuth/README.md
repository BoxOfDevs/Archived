SingleAuth Description
======================
SingleAuth is a plugin which sets a universal password for the server so that when a player joins they have to type the password the owner has told them into chat. It is just like any other auth plugin except for the feature of a universal password which all players use, easy for an owner with a whitelisted server to use. Also please note that there may be some bugs, please report them to me and I will try and fix them as soon as possible - Enjoy :)

Completed Features
===================
   • When the player joins it asks for the universal password, if they put the right password in they are then unfrozen and are able to play normally as well as being added to the whitelist, if they out the wrong password in they are asked for the password again.
   
   • Various commands.

   • /login <password> - Logs into the server (alias = /log).

   • /checkpass - Shows the universal password for the server (alias = /cp).
